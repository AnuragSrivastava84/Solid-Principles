# Solid-Principles

In the object oriented programming the SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for the five software engineering principles to make the software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.

The term SOLID means

# S - Single Responsibility principle
This principle says that a class should have only one responsibility, that means, If a class is design for handling the file operation then it should not handle other operation like sending the email.

# O - Open and closed principle
This principle says that the software entities should be open for the extension but closed for the modifications, that means, software entities like class or interfaces should open for the extension, means in the interface, we may add more method, but closed for the modification, means we should not modify any existing methods.

# L - Liskov Substitution principle
This principle says that objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

# I - Interface Segregation principle
This principle says that many client specific interface are better than the one general purpose interface.

# D - Dependency Inversion principle
This principle says that one should depends on the abstractions not concretions, mean, this principle offers a way to decouple the software modules by following dependency inversion pattern for example.
